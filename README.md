## Project Overview

MockAddress Core is a **pure frontend, zero backend dependency** test data engine designed for developers and QA engineers, providing:

- **Authentic-format address data** conforming to official postal standards (verifiable on Google Maps / Apple Maps)
- Optional **identity fields + credit card fields** (for form/payment flow testing only)
- **MAC address generation + vendor lookup + IPv6 Link-Local derivation** and other network test data

All core logic runs entirely in the browser and can be deployed to any static hosting environment (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, etc.).

> **Note**: This repository only open-sources the **engine and base styles**.  
> Large-scale address datasets and production site page templates remain MockAddress private assets for online services.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Country/Region Address Generation (Engine Support)**
  - Supports generating address structures conforming to local postal standards for multiple countries/regions
  - Address fields include complete information: street, city, state/province, postal code, country, etc.
  - Can be extended with localized fields based on country (e.g., Japanese address hierarchy, Hong Kong bilingual addresses)

- **Authentic Format & Verifiable**
  - Address data is based on official postal/statistical data + OpenStreetMap and other public data sources, cleaned and organized
  - Generated results are designed to be **verifiable on Google Maps / Apple Maps and other mapping services**
  - Suitable for registration forms, payment pages, tax calculation logic, and other scenarios requiring strict address format validation

- **Optional Identity & Credit Card Fields (Testing Only)**
  - Optionally generate name, gender, date of birth, occupation, localized ID number formats, etc.
  - Optionally generate credit card numbers (Luhn-validated), expiration date, CVC, and other fields
  - All identity/card data is **randomly generated and does not correspond to any real individuals or real cards**

- **Batch Export & Automation-Friendly**
  - Built-in CSV / JSON export capabilities
  - Suitable for automated testing, regression testing, CI/CD pipelines for bulk test data injection

- **MAC Tools**
  - Generate MAC addresses in multiple formats (colon, hyphen, dot, no separator, etc.)
  - Vendor identification based on OUI dataset
  - Support for deriving IPv6 Link-Local addresses from MAC addresses
  - All logic runs locally in the browser, suitable for network testing, device simulation, and script development

- **Pure Frontend, Privacy-First**
  - No backend service dependency, all logic completed in frontend JS
  - Optionally save generated results to browser `localStorage`, servers do not store any generated data

## Usage

### Quick Start

**Option 1: Direct Use (if your data directory is `data/`)**

```html
<script type="module">
  import { generateUSAddress } from './src/js/address-generator.js'
  
  // Direct use, will automatically detect data/ directory
  const address = await generateUSAddress('CA')
  console.log(address)
</script>
```

**Option 2: Custom Data Path (Recommended)**

```html
<script type="module">
  // 1. Import configuration module
  import { configure } from './src/js/config.js'
  import { generateUSAddress } from './src/js/address-generator.js'
  
  // 2. Configure your data path
  configure({
    dataBasePath: 'my-data/',  // Your data directory
    autoDetectPaths: false     // Disable auto-detection
  })
  
  // 3. Use normally
  const address = await generateUSAddress('CA')
  console.log(address)
</script>
```

### Configuration Options

- **`dataBasePath`**: Base path for your data files (e.g., `'my-data/'`, `'/static/data/'`)
- **`autoDetectPaths`**: Whether to enable automatic path detection (default `true`, suitable for mockaddress.com's multi-language structure)

> **Important**: If you don't call `configure()`, the code will use default behavior, **completely unaffected by mockaddress.com's normal operation**.

### Available Functions

- `generateUSAddress(state)` - US addresses
- `generateHKAddress(region, isEnglish)` - Hong Kong addresses
- `generateUKAddress(region)` - UK addresses
- `generateCAAddress(province)` - Canada addresses
- `generateJPAddress(prefecture)` - Japan addresses
- `generateINAddress(state)` - India addresses
- `generateTWAddress(county)` - Taiwan addresses
- `generateSGAddress(state)` - Singapore addresses
- `generateDEAddress(state)` - Germany addresses
- `generateTaxFreeAddress(state)` - US tax-free state addresses
- `generateIdentityInfo(address)` - Identity information
- `generateCreditCardInfo()` - Credit card information (testing only)

For detailed usage instructions, see [`使用说明.md`](./使用说明.md) (Usage Guide in Chinese).

You can also refer to our production site <https://mockaddress.com/> to see real-world usage scenarios and UI design, then customize as needed in your own project.

## Deployment Examples: Cloudflare & VPS (Static Hosting)

> The following steps are for developers who want to deploy mockaddress-core themselves, describing only the simplest path for README purposes.

### Deploy with Cloudflare Pages (Recommended for Frontend / Zero Ops Cost Scenarios)

1. Create a repository on GitHub (e.g., `mockaddress-core`), push this project's code to it.
2. Log in to Cloudflare, go to **Pages**, select "Create a project with Git provider", and bind this repository.
3. Build settings:
   - Framework preset: **None / Static Site**
   - Build command: Leave empty (or `npm run build` if you add a build process later)
   - Output directory: Set to project root (or your build output directory)
4. After deployment, ensure:
   - All JS/CSS load correctly via `<script type="module">` / `<link>` relative paths;
   - If you have multi-language subdirectory structures (e.g., `/en/`, `/ru/`), maintain the same directory hierarchy in the repository.

> **Note**: If you only want to open-source the core and don't want to expose the full site, you can deploy only a minimal demo page (or just screenshots, directing users to the production site in the README).

### Deploy with VPS + Nginx (Suitable for Existing Servers)

1. Build or organize the static file structure locally (`src/js`, `src/css`, and your HTML entry).
2. Upload these static files to your VPS (e.g., `/var/www/mockaddress-core` directory).
3. Configure Nginx site (example):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    root /var/www/mockaddress-core;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

4. Reload Nginx: `nginx -s reload` or use the corresponding service management command.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://your-domain.com` to confirm address generation/MAC tools and other features work correctly.

> **VPS deployment essence**: Host this set of frontend files as a **pure static site**, no Node.js / PHP / database or other backend environment required.
